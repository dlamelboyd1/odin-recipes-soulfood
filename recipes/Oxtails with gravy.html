<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>The tail has a long bone that is surrounded by highly gelatinous meat making it very flavorful and desirable. For those unfamiliar, oxtails aren't actually the tail from an ox, but are the tails from cows cut into pieces. Each piece has a thick cylindrical bone with chunks of tough, fatty meat.</p>
